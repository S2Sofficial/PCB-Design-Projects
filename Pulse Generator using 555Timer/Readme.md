# Pulse Generator Circuit Using 555 Timer IC  

## Overview  
This project focuses on designing and implementing a **pulse generator circuit** using the versatile **555 Timer IC**. Starting with schematic design, I explored the process of validating the circuit through simulation, designing the PCB layout, and preparing files for manufacturing.  

This project serves as an introduction to PCB design principles and practical implementation using the EasyEDA platform, combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on practice.
